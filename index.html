		<p>ScribTeX has now shutdown. Thank you to everybody who has supported and used ScribTeX over the past 5 years.</p>

		<p>If you're looking for a new online LaTeX editor, the team behind ScribTeX is now working on <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com">ShareLaTeX</a></p>

		<p>If you had an important project that you did not save before the shutdown deadline, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@sharelatex.com">team@sharelatex.com</a><p>
